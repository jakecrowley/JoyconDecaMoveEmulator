# Joycon DecaMove Emulator
A very WIP DecaMove emulator for Joycons.

## Installation

1. Install DecaHub.

2. Clone the github repository or download the zip archive and extract all files.

3. Connect Joycon to PC via Bluetooth.

4. Navigate to 'DecaMoveEmulator\bin\x64\Debug' and run DecaMoveEmulator.exe
If com0com is not installed, it will instruct you to install it. Once you get to "Choose components" ensure that CNCA0 <-> CNCB0 is UNCHECKED. Press enter to continue running once the installation is complete.

5. SteamVR should start automatically, launch any compatible game from DecaHub.
